## Description

This repository contains sports and travel tools and tips (including apps and utilities) used and recommended by me.

## Tools

### GPSmyCity to GPX converter

[gpsmycity-to-gpx-converter.py](https://github.com/roboes/travel-tools/blob/main/gpsmycity-to-gpx-converter.py) is a script that downloads one or more self-guided GPSmyCity tours URLs as .gpx files. The .gpx files can be imported directly or converted to .kml and be used in multiple apps (see [here](#apps)).

#### Python dependencies

```python -m pip install gpxpy numpy pandas werkzeug```

## Utilities

### Cycling

#### Cycling routes

[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/discover): to download routes as .gpx files, see the [Komoot](#komoot) section.    
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/segments/explore): the best way to find cycling routes in Strava is to open a segment in the desired location and open the profiles of some atheletes, viewing their activities. To download activities as .gpx files, use the [Strava GPX downloader Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strava-gpx-downloader/pnglhfabfkchkadgnkfacoakincdpeeg).


### Hiking

#### Hiking routes
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/discover): to download routes as .gpx files, see the [Komoot](#komoot) section.  
[AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore): requires login to download routes as .gpx.  
[Outdooractive](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/routes/): requires login to download routes as .gpx.  

Files can be downloaded as a .gpx files and imported in apps (see [here](#apps)) or fitness devices (e.g. Garmin devices).

## Apps

Although .gpx has grown in popularity in recent years, not all of the apps listed below allow you to import them directly. Some apps (e.g. Organic Maps) require the conversion of .gpx to .kml in order to be imported. There are plenty of online tools that perform such conversion (e.g. [Gpx2kml.com](https://gpx2kml.com)).

### OsmAnd

#### Description  
Excellent app for cycling and hiking. Features include import and display .gpx routes, overlay specific POIs (e.g. Drinking Water).

#### Add-ons  
[Online-maps sources for OsmAnd](https://anygis.ru/Web/Html/Osmand_en): contains various layers that can be added to OsmAnd, including Strava multiple heatmaps (all activity types, ride, run and water activities).

### Komoot
([Website](https://www.komoot.de) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.komoot.android) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/komoot-route-planner-gps/id447374873))

#### Description
Excellent app for finding cycling/hiking routes and creating/editing routes (requires log-in). Premium subscription/purchases allow to download .gpx files to other apps (alternatively, some GitHub repositories bypass this restriction and allow to download .gpx files, as for example [KomootGPX
](https://github.com/ThePBone/KomootGPX)).
Map base: OpenStreetMap (OSM).

### Organic Maps
([Website](https://organicmaps.app) | [GitHub](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057))

#### Description
Fork of Maps.me, is a simple and intuitive app for accessing the OpenStreetMap (OSM) map base offline. In some countries, OSM is better than Google Maps and HERE WeGo (e.g. the Morocco's medinas were not mapped in Google Maps/HERE WeGo maps base). It also allows to easily find Sight amenities (e.g. all Plitvice Lakes view points).
